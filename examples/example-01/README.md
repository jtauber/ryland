# Example 01

One common use case for me is wanting to just write a bunch of HTML but keeping it DRY using Jinja's template extension and inclusion features. This example shows how to do that with just a few lines of code.

```sh
# in a virtual env with Ryland installed

./build.py
(cd output; python -m http.server)

# visit localhost:8000 in a browser
```
